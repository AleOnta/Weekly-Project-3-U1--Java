# Weekly-Project-3-U1--Java

In this exercise we were instructed to build a library archive throught Java class and PostgreSQL.
We were supposed to connect the project with our own database, with his respective relations between tables.
This is a Java project converted in a Maven Project and then converted in a JPA project, as dependencies, Lombok, LogBack, Hiibernate & PostgreSQL were added.
I had some issue finding the correct way to connect each table with other ones (relations) - i've tried to apply what seen during the lessons on PostgreSQL relations,
but i wasn't able to achieve what i was asked to do.
I'll update the repo in the next days, trying to fix the missing parts i've left behind.
